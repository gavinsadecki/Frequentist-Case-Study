    "Welcome to part A of the Frequentist inference case study! The purpose of this case study is to help you apply the concepts associated with Frequentist inference in Python. Frequentist inference is the process of deriving conclusions about an underlying distribution via the observation of data. In particular, you'll practice writing Python code to apply the following statistical concepts: \n",
    "* the _z_-statistic\n",
    "* the _t_-statistic\n",
    "* the difference and relationship between the two\n",
    "* the Central Limit Theorem, including its assumptions and consequences\n",
    "* how to estimate the population mean and standard deviation from a sample\n",
    "* the concept of a sampling distribution of a test statistic, particularly for the mean\n",

    "__A:__ The answer is 84%. \n",
    "A standard normal distribution has a mean of 0(Where the peak is) and a std of 1. Using the fact that the area within 1 std deviation of the mean is 68% means that the chance of a value between -1 and 1 is 68%. This is symmetric so that means it's a 34% chance between 0 and 1. Since the mean is at 0, which is the center, 50% of the graph is below 0(negative) and 50% is above(postitive). We want to take 50% for all the negative numbers and 34% for the interval of [0,1] and that gives us the range for (-$\\infty$,1], which is 84%."

This is the key driver for us 'requiring' a certain sample size, for example you may frequently see a minimum sample size of 30 stated in many places.
